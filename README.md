# React Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio website built with **React** and **Vite**.  
The primary goal of this project is to **learn modern React patterns** while building something real, useful, and continuously improvable.

Rather than following a tutorial end-to-end, this project evolves incrementally as I explore new concepts and best practices in the React ecosystem.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Learn and apply **modern React fundamentals**
- Practice building a real-world SPA from scratch
- Demonstrate clean component structure and routing
- Integrate third-party APIs (GitHub)
- Continuously expand the app as my skills grow

This site serves both as:
- A **learning sandbox** for React
- A **professional portfolio** to showcase projects and progress
